        {` I’m Todd Perumal — a product builder, lifelong learner, and believer in momentum over perfection.
        I started Signal and Stories as a place to learn in public, explore economic and behavioral signals, and turn insights into small, tangible experiments.
        This site is my sandbox. Some weeks I’ll build features. Other weeks I’ll analyze data, write essays, or ship new components.
        But every week, I’ll be pushing forward — stacking signal, shipping stories, and learning from the process.`}
